# inn-bot
Discord Bot for use in the Imperial News Network channel. Makes use of [elizabot.js](http://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/) to have natural language conversations and fetches data from [Roberts Space Industries](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/) for Star Citizen funding, citizens and UEE commands.

## How to Use
In order to use this you'll need at least NodeJS installed. It helps to have Git to clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ImperialNewsNetwork/inn-bot.git
$ cd inn-bot
$ npm install
$ node run.js <bot_token> <app_id>
```
Replace `<bot_token>` with your Bot User Token and `<app_id>` with the Client ID from [Discord Developer](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). You can use the url below, replacing `<app_id>` with the Client ID from the Developer page, to add it to a server you have 'Manage Server' permissions on.
```
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=<app_id>&scope=bot
```
You can then use the `!invite` command to get the URL in future.
